##  I never liked the term 'Rugged Software', what about Robust/Resilient Software? 

I still have not fully rationalised why I don't like (as security professional and as a developer) the term (and some parts of the concept) of the [Rugged Software](http://www.ruggedsoftware.org/)

Recently when talking about similar concepts (i.e. writing secure code/applications) I found myself talking about the need to create **Robust/Resilient Applications.**  
**  
**Isn't **Resilient Software **a better term to describe applications/code that are able to correctly handle, mitigate and react to malicious behaviour/input?
