##  Submitting a request to the OWASP Platform 

Here is a message from [Sarah Baso](mailto:sarah.baso@owasp.org) on how to ask a question to them :)

The original question was about how to get OWASP support for participating in local events.

  
--------------------

_In the future, please submit any requests/questions through the OWASP "contact us" page to help us track all incoming questions requests and help make sure they are addressed in a timely fashion: [http://owasp4.owasp.org/contactus.html](http://owasp4.owasp.org/contactus.html)_

To answer your questions, it is possible for OWASP to support these efforts - we will need a bit more information though.

1. All events (except for chapter meetings) should be submitted through our OWASP Event Management System (OEMS):  
[https://ocms.owasp.org/](https://ocms.owasp.org/)

2. To request OWASP Merchandise or other materials, please complete this google form:
