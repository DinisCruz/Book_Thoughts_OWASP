OWASP Partners with National Collegiate Cyber Security Competition

**The National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition**

The Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) is the first competition system that focuses on the operational aspect of managing and protecting an existing "commercial" network infrastructure. CCDC allows teams of undergraduate and graduate students at universities across the United States to exercise their academic and technical education and compete in a business oriented, defense information assurance competition. CCDC is a tiered competition with qualifying and regional events leading to a national championship.   
CCDC Competitions ask students teams to assume administrative and protective duties for an existing "commercial" network -- typically a small company with 50+ users, 10-12 servers, and common internet services such as a web server, mail server, and an e-commerce site. Each team begins the competition with an identical set of hardware and software and is scored on their ability to detect and respond to outside threats, maintain availability of existing services, respond to business requests such as the creation of a new e-commerce site, and balance security best practices against business needs.  2013 qualifiers kick off in February with the regional competitions taking place in March and our National CCDC will be held April 19-21, 2013 in San Antonio, TX.
