##  Why the need to enable the use of OWASP chapter funds 

_I just send the text below to the OWASP Leaders list, which was part of [this thread](http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2013-June/009446.html)_  
_  
__My answer was to  [Tim's comment](http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2013-June/009459.html) and I started a [new thread with it](http://lists.owasp.org/pipermail/owasp-leaders/2013-June/009487.html)_

-------------

Tim's solution (see below) is great and we should apply it now (using data from the last year). The only thing I would change is to remove the C (soft cap) and  P (hard cap). This would have a net positive result for all chapters (and not move the money to the 'OWASP mothership' which is a very sensitive topic).  


  


For the ones really interested in this thread/topic, you should read the amazing Seth Godin's post [Non-profits have a charter to be innovators](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2012/11/non-profits-more-innovative.html) which really explains why OWASP (as an organisation) as the DUTY and moral responsibility to spend its available funds, to experiment, to get things done, etc....)

  
  


The other very important question is **WHY!  **(as explained by the also amazing ['Why how what' presentation by Simon Sinek](http://www.ted.com/talks/simon_sinek_how_great_leaders_inspire_action.html))   

  


Why does OWASP need money?

Why do chapters need money? 

Why should owasp leaders use their political/business/personal capital in becoming a 'vendor' for OWASP?

  


In my view, OWASP needs money to **Get Stuff Done!**

**  
**

And although there is always an idea that OWASP funds will be massively wasted, the reality (just look back at History) is that **It is very hard to spend OWASP Money**

**  
**

The best examples are the dormant funds in the Chapters, the Project Reboot funds that have barely been used and (my failed attempt) at the [GSD project (Get Stuff Done)](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_GSD_Project) which has **3k USD that any of you could spend TODAY**

  


As I mentioned in my [OWASP Revenue Splits and the "Non-profits have a charter to be innovators"](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2012/12/owasp-revenue-splits-and-non-profits.html) post, OWASP has a** 'How to spend the money' **problem and in the [160k USD available to OWASP Chapters and Projects](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2012/04/160k-usd-available-to-owasp-chapters.html) (written in April 2012 hence the smaller amount) I wrote:

What is great about such_ 'owasp chapters global fund' _is that:

  * It moves the discussion from '_how much money do I have_' to '_what should I do with the funds available_'
  * It really supports the chapters that don't have a lot of funds today
  * It can also also benefit chapters with substancial funds today, since there is no reason why they can't also access those resources
  * it promotes accountability and ownership of funds allocated
  * it puts an 'artificial' timeline on the use of funds allocated (i.e. there is a 'pressure' to deliver)
  * it helps to find the OWASP leaders who know how to spend OWASP funds and make magic happen (like Fabio with the Latam and EU tours)
  * It empowers action, and promotes the idea that '_we trust our chapter leaders to do the right thing'_
  * it documents the places where OWASP funds are used (making those ideas/actions easy to replicated)
  * it also documents the failed experiments (which are healthy, but don't need to be repeated :)  ). 
  * it stops the 'ownership of funds' and 'lets keep it in a safe place' that we currently have
  * It can dramatically simplify how the funds are accessed since there will be a central point of contact and pot (with better/faster processes that world worldwide)
  * it turns up the volume/pressure on the '_% of OWASP funds used',  _since everytime _**something that could happen, doesn't happen**, _OWASP misses an opportunity (and we need some 'urgency' and focus on 'not lossing those opportunities). 

See the rules I wrote down at the [GSD project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_GSD_Project) for how this could work in practice.

  


Like I mentioned before, I don't really care about where the money is, and what percentages there are in place (in fact history is showing us how divisive those splits can be). The point is that **OWASP Funds MUST be available to Who wants to use them!**

**  
**

And as I listed in [I wish that OWASP in 2014 ....](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2012/11/i-wish-that-owasp-in-2014.html), it would be great that one day we will have at OWASP:

  * _...._
  * _a model where OWASP leaders are empowered to make financial decisions/commitments and spend the available OWASP funds in the way they believe is best, with no (very little) questions asked and very fast approval cycles (see the GSD project for details)  
_
  * _...._

Yes, this is what came to my mind as well.  Incorporating Dinis  
suggestion and some of my own ideas, what about this:

Corporate membership dues: 25% to chapter, 75% to foundation  
Conference/event profits: 25% to chapter, 75% to foundation

Any chapters can "overdraw" their chapter account and pull from the  
chapter pool.  Perhaps some kind of limit should be put on how much  
any given chapter pulls from the shared pool in a year.

Reasoning:

> I think individual membership dues are important to keep with the  
chapter.  It encourages contribution and participation at the local  
level.  Corporate membership is probably not quite the same in that  
way.  Also, I'm guessing individual membership dues are not the  
biggest contributor to chapter funds right now (whereas conferences  
and corporate contributions probably are), so it isn't going to cause  
a big lockup of funds by putting more of the individual dues toward a  
chapter.

what we are doing this year in 2013 where a $500 overdraw was offered  
to poor chapters.  I think this overdraw ability is *very* useful to  
new chapters.
