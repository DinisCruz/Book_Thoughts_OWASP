##  Proposal: Remove all commercial/non-OWASP logos from OWASP.org 

Following the recent threads about the commercialization of OWASP, I think the time as come for a simple move, that will be a little bit painful, but will clear the water and send a nice big message of what OWASP stands for.  


  


**Remove all commercial/non-owasp-projects logos from OWASP.org**  


This move has a log of advantages:

  * it is generic so it doesn't single out anybody
  * it can be done since there are no 'real' contractual obligations for OWASP to put company's XYZ logo on the OWASP site 

  * note that OWASP can change the contents of any content/text hosted on [owasp.org](http://owasp.org/) , as long as the changes are released in an compatible license :)
  * in fact anybody can start the [http://owasp-without-logos.org](http://owasp-without-logos.org/) site with all content from [owasp.org](http://owasp.org/), expect the 3rd party logos

* it will push the cases where sponsor-logos are expected to exist, to be placed in separate/dedicated 3rd party websites (like what happens with AppSec conferences)

  * and if there ARE execptions, they should be treated as one-of exceptions (and be fully documented)

* it will stop the current **_'F1/NASCAR logo parade'_** that is the OWASP main page, and some of its projects
* it will stop the nasty and non-productive **_"hey that company shouldn't have their logo in that project"_** threads
* it will send a strong message that OWASP is about sharing information and all information/tools/projects that are 'donated' to owasp are supposed to be shared in a no-strings/logos attached mode
* it will clarify that **the OWASP logo, name, tools and content CAN be used in commercial situations, as long as it is done outside of OWASP.org**
* it shows a sign of maturity for OWASP, where OWASP doesn't need (anymore) to sell a bit of its soul in exchange for good content and tools
* it shows that OWASP's value to the corporate sponsors, is NOT a logo on [owasp.org](http://owasp.org/), but the amazing value provided by the multiple OWASP activities, events and projects.
* it shows that OWASP can learn from others, and in this case, follow (as Jim recommended) the Apache foundation example (see [http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/responsibility.html](http://www.apache.org/foundation/marks/responsibility.html) )

There are a couple disadvantages:

  * Some OWASP leaders and supporting companies will be annoyed and fell that _'OWASP changed the value-added they would get by contributing to OWASP'_
  * Some OWASP corporate sponsors might even be so angry that they don't renew their anual membership
  * Some OWASP leaders might be so annoyed that they stop contributing at all to OWASP
  * This is one of those issues that has the potential to generate a gazilion of emails, with lots of opinions and no decisions in the end. Btw, the faster 'a' decision is made the better (Yes or No). 

I believe that OWASP today (April 2013) is in the perfect situation to make this move. There is enough money to sustain any financial loss (which I don't think will happen) and the OWASP projects are still in a state where a drop of a couple OWASP leaders wouldn't have a dramatic effect (which again i don't think will happen)

  


So what do you say, fellow OWASP friends, should we make this jump?

  


**My vote is YES, lets get rid of the commercial logos in OWASP and start a new generation of OWASP content and tools**
