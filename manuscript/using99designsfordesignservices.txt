##  Using 99Designs for Design services 

Just saw [http://99designs.co.uk/](http://99designs.co.uk/) in action on the logo commissioned by Mark for the Seconauts community : [http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/create-next-logo-seconauts-152818](http://99designs.co.uk/logo-design/contests/create-next-logo-seconauts-152818)

Look like a pretty sweet and slick service. We should use it more at OWASP

I have been using [elance.com](http://elance.com/) for a while which is also pretty powerful
