##  Presenting at OWASP Turkey Chapter on Sat 10th of November (on Secure Continuous Delivery) 

If you happen to be in Turkey this weekend, there is a great OWASP event happening tomorrow, where I'm also presenting on _"Secure Continuous Delivery: Developer's Immediate Connection to What They're Creating"._

This is basically going to be a review of the O2 Platform and development work I have been doing for the past years (namely in trying to automate application security knowledge).

I will post the slides after the event (and I have completed them :)  )
