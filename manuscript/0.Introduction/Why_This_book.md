## Why This book

I put this book together because I wanted to capture the evolution of my 'Thinking on OWASP'. Although I don't think that all my thoughts/ideas are correct or any good, I do feel that some are OK and deserve to be preserved and shared.

I also think that it is important for the new generations of OWASP Leaders to understand the past and to learn from what has happened before. Specially important is to learn from others mistakes (like mine).

Also captured in this book are a number of mine 'soul searching' and 'philosophy' based posts. I hope you like them :)

### The selection criteria

The initial import from my blog was made of 76 blog posts which resulted in an book with 256 pages and 54,277 words. Part of that list where a number of posts that covered a wide range of OWASP topics (which is why I used the OWASP tag them on them), but since this is more of a 'ideas' book, I used the following criteria to trim the content (also note that most of this posts will exist on other books).
