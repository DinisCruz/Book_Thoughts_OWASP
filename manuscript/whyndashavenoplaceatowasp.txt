##  Why NDAs have no place at OWASP 

I was looking for a place to link why it is such a bad idea for OWASP to consider or accept the idea of signing NDA's with 3rd parties, and since I couldn't find it on the OWASP Wiki, I'm reposting here what I wrote in June 2011:  
  

    
    _I don't buy the argument that there is a ton of opportunities that OWASP is  
    missing because we don't have this 'save harbour' locations to talk.
    
    The other key concept that you guys are missing is that the 'no  
    NDA everything is public' is actually the best way for *OWASP to control  
    OWASP* and to prevent the existence of 'pockets of knowledge' or 'groups  
    that know more than others' inside OWASP (just try to image how this would  
    work in practice and you will see how impractical this would be).
    
    If we want to preserve our community and open spirit we need to have  
    an uncompromising Open environment.
    
    I would also argue that a big problem in our industry (and software  
    development/apps in general) is the excessive use of NDA and lack of  
    information sharing. So if any thing, OWASP should be pushing the other  
    direction and be actively promoting dialog and 'conversations'
    
    For example look at how we were able at the last OWASP Summit to get  
    directly competing companies to sit on the same table and talk 'openly'.  
    THAT is what we need to. Create the time and place, and the dialog with  
    OWASP will come.

    A good example of the mess created by providing 'secret data' to an OWASP leaders (with the promisse the it wont be disclosed) if what has happened with the OWASP Top 10 data. See this post: [Stats used to support OWASP Top 10 entries (next version must publish them)](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2013/01/stats-used-to-support-owasp-top-10.html) for more details.
