##  Improved Wikipedia funding page, why OWASP needs something similar, and who buys OWASP Corporate Memberships 

Just went to Wikipedia and saw this:

which just sounded fair (and much better that looking at [Jimmy's eyes](http://readwrite.com/2010/11/19/wikipedia_has_raised_in_a_week_what_took_a_month_i) :) ), so I clicked on the **Please Help **Button and used Paypal to help with       Â£20:

and since it was so easy to retweet, I also did that too :)

I think it is very important for Wikipedia to have [a funding model](http://www.economist.com/node/21536580) that keeps [it ad free](http://readwrite.com/2011/01/01/wikipedia_raises_16_million_to_remain_ad-free) and comes directly from it's users (which means that the '_Wikipedia Users_' are the '_Wikipedia Customers_' instead of being the '_Wikipedia Product_' (which btw, is what users are for Google, Facebook, Twitter, etc..)).

In fact that is why it was such an easy decision for me to 'help' (which is a better word than 'donate') since I value Wikipedia's services (provided by its operational machine) and I want to be Wikipedia's _Customer_ not its _Product_

Now OWASP really needs to figure out a similar model, since the current membership model works OKish but creates massive conflicts of interrest.

**Ideally OWASP should be funded by its users, not by the companies that provides services to its users.**  
**  
**Of course that there are some exceptions (like Mozilla) but if you look at the [shopping list of logos that is the membership page](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Membership) that is a massive security product/vendor collection.

And btw, I think the time as come to remove the OWASP Membership logos from the HomePage, its getting ridiculous:

_Are we really THAT independent and vendor neutral?_  
_  
_Here is an interesting question (since OWASP generates revenue and is profitable):** WHO and WHAT are OWASP's product? I.e. what is OWASP really selling? **

As an OWASP **Leader**, am I the product? or the customer?  
As an OWASP **User**, am I the product? or the customer?  
As an OWASP **Corporate Member**, am I the product? or the customer?  
As an OWASP **AppSec Conference or Chapter speaker,** am I the product? or the customer?  
As an OWASP **AppSec Conference or Chapter attendee,** am I the product? or the customer?

This actually takes me to another really interesting question which is '**What is the drive behind an OWASP Corporate Memberships' **(the [5k USD one](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Corporate_Member))?

My theory is that in most cases (90%+) **these memberships are directly connected to an OWASP leader** (I don't think this analysis has been done, but from all the OWASP leaders I know, this fells right). Important questions to answer are:

  * _"what is the time-delta between 'somebody' becoming an OWASP leader, and the company he/she is working for, becoming an OWASP Corporate member?"_
  * _"how many __OWASP Corporate members exists that have NO OWASP leader(s) in its payroll?'_
  * _"how many lapsed (or not renewed) OWASP Corporate Memberships happened from companies whose past (in payroll) OWASP Leader(s) are not 'active at OWASP' any more?"_
  * _"how many __OWASP Corporate members exists from companies that provide NO security services or products"_
  * __"how many __OWASP Corporate members exists from 'development organisations'  (i.e. companies or groups focused on writing secure code)" (for example it doesn't look like [Etsy is a member](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/open-question-to-etsy-security-team-how.html))__

  
What is important about this idea, is that **IF OWASP memberships are a direct or 'natural' consequence/evolution of an OWASP Leader existence,** that would mean that OWASP's lack of focus on its leaders, is not only '_the wrong thing to do_' but a very bad business decision.

One of the things I tried most when I was a board member was to get OWASP to take more care about its leaders, and it was always an up-hill battle because there is this view that '_hey the leaders contribute because they want'_ (I remember having to argue hard for the concepts of _'OWASP Leaders are given free OWASP Memberships' _and _'OWASP Leaders can go for free to any OWASP conference'_).

It is critical for OWASP's future to look after its leaders much better than it currently does, and if you look at my list on [I wish that OWASP in 2014 ....](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/11/i-wish-that-owasp-in-2014.html) you will see that most are _'OWASP leaders focused'._

Focusing on OWASP Leaders is a [win-win situation](http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/win-win) and what makes sense from a commercial point of view!

The more OWASP invests and looks after its leaders, the:

  * better projects OWASP will have
  * better presenters OWASP will have
  * more Corporate memberships will exist
  * more value OWASP will be providing to its key target audiences: developers/companies who want to write/buy/use secure code
