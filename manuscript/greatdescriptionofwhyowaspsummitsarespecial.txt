##  Great description of why OWASP Summits are special 

Abe (on the owasp-leaders list) just posted the text below in response to my [Summits must be part of OWASP's DNA](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/summits-must-be-part-of-owasps-dna.html) reply and it provides one of the best descriptions of what makes Owasp Summit's special and worthwhile doing (please read it).  


  


If you've never been to one of our Summits, this is why they are so important and necessary (Imagine what we could achieve with regular Summits)

I think people would be willing to pay to attend a conference where they could speak to other leaders in informal meetings on topics of interest and provide the additional benefit of OWASP deliverables.

I got to laugh with people I would have never had the chance to before this.  Jokes don't seem to go over as well when they are made over email.  I got to hear stories of (Larry's or Chris's -- the last names have been omitted to protect the Guilty) midget experiences/encounters.  I got to know of other people skeleton's in their closets.

I met Andras (my German brother) of [WS-Attacks.org](http://ws-attacks.org/) and although I haven't done a good job of it yet, I was hoping to reboot the OWASP Web Development Guide (I will send another email on that thread to explain my struggles) and see if I could use the content from [WS-Attacks.org](http://ws-attacks.org/) in the new guide (seeing as I did the translation revision for Andras) for the Web Services chapter.  If I didn't attend the Summit I wouldn't have met him and made this connection.
