##  Hack Yourself First: Jeremiah at TEDxMaui 

Jeremiah was recently at [TEDxMaui](http://tedxmaui.com/) presenting [Hack Yourself First](http://tedxtalks.ted.com/video/TEDxMaui-Jeremiah-Grossman-Hack) which is an interesting development for WebAppSec and OWASP since I think it is the first time that a member of our community gets to present at TED (which is one of the best conference-series in the world)

Couple comments:

  * he was quite nervous, which shows the 'pressure to deliver' that TED has. 

    * See Jeremiah's [Written Speech](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/written-speech-tedxmaui-hack-yourself.html) (i.e. what he wanted to say) and his  [personal comments about the experience](http://jeremiahgrossman.blogspot.co.uk/2012/01/tedxmaui-hack-yourself-first.html))

  * I really like the concept of 'Hack yourself first' but I wished Jeremiah had given more examples on how to do it an a personal, corporate and organisational level
  * there was FAR too much FUD for my taste. I would had been better if he found a more positive way to deliver the message
  * It is also quite obvious by Jeremiah performance that he really cares about WebAppSec and wants to make the world more secure

    * Of course that he owns a company that helps companies to 'Hack themselves first' so there is a lot of vested interest in there too :)

  * I think that OWASP doesn't get one mention, which is not Jeremiah's fault. I just shows the weakness of the OWASP Brand
