##  When is the next OWASP Summit!!!!! 

Looking at the [OWASP Summit pictures](https://picasaweb.google.com/103054218257696470914/OWASPSummit?gsessionid=5EHA7D4GzGOw0L8iAqcVrw#) reminded me of the amazing experience that the [OWASP Summit 2011](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011) was. There was so much positive energy in the air and we got much done (see [the final report](http://sl.owasp.org/summit2011_finalreport) and the [session's outcomes](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Summit_2011_Outcomes)).

We need another one!!!!

Surely we can have one in 2013!

But if we are going to do it, we have to do it right :)
