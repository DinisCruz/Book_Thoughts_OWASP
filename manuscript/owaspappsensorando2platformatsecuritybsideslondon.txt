##  OWASP AppSensor and O2 Platform at Security B-Sides London 

([reblogging Colin's post about this event](https://www.clerkendweller.com/2013/4/19/AppSensor-at-Security-BSides-London) :) )

Next week me and [Colin Watson](https://www.clerkendweller.com/) will be running an OWASP [AppSensor](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_AppSensor_Project) and [OWASP O2 Platform](http://blog.diniscruz.com/p/owasp-o2-platform.html) workshop at [Security B-Sides London 2013](http://www.securitybsides.org.uk/).

We will be demonstrating and helping attendees of the workshop specify, define and implement application-specific attack detection and real-time response. Our agenda is:   


  * OWASP AppSensor concept 
  * Attack detection exercise 
  * Real world implementation (using O2 Platform and TeamMentor)
  * Alternative deployment models

We'll be using paper-based materials and real code demonstrations (in .Net, Java and PHP), so just bring your brains along.

The [workshop](http://www.securitybsides.org.uk/workshops.html) is being run from 14:00 to 15:30 hrs on Wednesday April 24th 2013 and can be booked on arrival at the event. It is available on a first come, first served basis.

Security B-Sides London is a [community-driven free event](http://www.securitybsides.org.uk/about.html) but requires registration, but due to overwhelming demand there is a waiting list.

We hope to see you there.
