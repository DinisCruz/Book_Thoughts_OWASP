##  OWASP is Hiring a FT Event Manager (35k USD) 

Sarah Baso just posted the email below to the OWASP-leaders list which is a great move for OWASP.  


_OWASP Leaders -_

_We are looking for a motivated professional to take on management of OWASP Events.  _  
_  
_

__

_Job posting: [https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs](https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs)_

__

_Applications are being accepted until June 21, 2013 with interviews immediately following with a final decision made by July 5, 2013._  


_**How to apply:** Email a cover letter and resume with your name and the position you are applying for in the subject line to [owasp.foundation@owasp.org](mailto:owasp.foundation@owasp.org)._

__

**_Please help us spread the word about the position by posting to your chapter/project lists, adding to applicable job boards, or forwarding to any individuals that you think would be interested._**

If you know of a good candidate, please ask them to go to [https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs/Event_Manager](https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs/Event_Manager) and apply to [owasp.foundation@owasp.org](mailto:owasp.foundation@owasp.org)

The only thing I would change is that **ALL job application details (and correspondance) should be public, posted directly on the OWASP wiki**.

For example at [https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs/Event_Manager/Apply](https://owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_Jobs/Event_Manager/Apply) (vs the private email mode currently set-up)

This would provide maximum transparency and openness, and if the 'all process is open' expectation is set from the start, then there are no privacy of HR issues.
