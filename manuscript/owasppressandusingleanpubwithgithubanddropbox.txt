##  OWASP Press and using LeanPub with GitHub and DropBox 

As mentioned on my [934 page eBook/PDF with this blog from LeanPub.com](http://diniscruz.blogspot.com/2012/12/934-ebookpdf-with-this-blog-from.html) post, Dennis Groves has found a way to use GitHub with DropBox to manage the workflow of creating eBooks using [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/)

This is really great stuff, and you can read the details at his  [OWASP Press](http://scriptogr.am/dennis-groves/post/owasp-press) post.
