##  Great animation that shows how BootStrapToday works 

Checkout this video that I found on the the [http://bootstraptoday.com/](http://bootstraptoday.com/) homepage:  
  


  


It does a great job at explaining what it does.

  


**I want one of this for TeamMentor and O2!!!!**  (although I don't think O2 is ready for it). I wonder who did this video and how much it cost?

  


Btw, checkout their 'Security' page ([http://bootstraptoday.com/tour/security/](http://bootstraptoday.com/tour/security/)). Can you see what they missed? 

  


**Where's Application Security?** For example it doesn't really matter if there are separate databases with different permissions if the main app has access to all databases (where for example an business logic vulnerability would allow Customer X to access Customer Y data).
