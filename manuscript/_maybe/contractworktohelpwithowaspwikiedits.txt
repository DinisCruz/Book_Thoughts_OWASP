##  Contract work to help with OWASP Wiki edits 

_Here is an email I just sent to a couple contacts Samantha Groves (OWASP Project manager) gave me as resources I could use to make changes/edits to the OWASP wiki._

Hi ....

To move this forward, could you please answer these questions:  


  1. Do you have experience in editing wikis? 
  2. What about wikis using the WikiMedia engine (which is the one used by OWASP) 
  3. Do you know how to use [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion](http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Transclusion) ? 
  4. Do you have an account in the OWASP wiki? 
  5. Have you made any changes to the owasp wiki? And if so, can you point me to the best example of your work? 
  6. Do you have an CV online that I could take a look (LinkedIn would be great) 
  7. Have you used Git or GitHub? 
  8. Can you program? if so on what languages? 

Btw, don't worry if you answer NO to all these questions. I just want to get an idea of your experiences and owasp involvement  


  1. Please also answer these operational questions 
  2. What time zone are you in? 
  3. How much time can you spend on the 'wiki editing' tasks (a week) 
  4. Have you agreed a payment model/rate with OWASP/Samantha? 
  5. Where/how should we track the work done (i.e. what counts as 'payable' work) 

Thanks
