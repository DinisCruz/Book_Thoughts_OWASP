##  OWASP GSD Project (GSD = Get Stuff Done) 

Yesterday I started the [OWASP GSD Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_GSD_Project), based on:  


  * the ideas first presented on [OWASP Project Reboot 2012 - Here is a better model](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/owasp-project-reboot-2012-here-is.html),
  * the fact that there is a good amount of funds available at OWASP ([160k USD available to OWASP Chapters and Projects](http://diniscruz.blogspot.co.uk/2012/04/160k-usd-available-to-owasp-chapters.html)) and 
  * the need that OWASP has to inject energy into its projects, .

The Project's main page is at: [https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_GSD_Project](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/OWASP_GSD_Project)  and below (end of this post) you will find a copy and paste of today's version of this project page (which is the first pass at defining what the GSD is)

  
What I like about this model is that is **as empowering as I think one can make it.**

Basically this model:

  * Empowers OWASP leaders to spend funds on OWASP projects
  * Puts a very 'light' moderation/control system in place, where proposals are approved by default  (in 1 day for < $500  and 7 days for < $5000)
  * Creates a chain of trust beween the multiple parties
  * Can be this simple due to the key '_OWASP leaders cannot be paid'_ rule
  * It is based on trust and reputation
  * It is designed to be simple to use and could be easy abused
  * It is a grass-roots, bottom up approach (i.e. done from the OWASP Community to the OWASP Community)

  
Now you might think that such system would be abused. My experience in implementing very similar solutions (at OWASP and other places) has shown me that in an open environment, it is very hard to abuse the system in a way that doesn't (eventually) backfire.

The only places I've seem 'abuses' is when the information is not clearly presented, attributed and linked

In a way, a system like this shows how hard it is to get stuff done at an organisation like OWASP. Even when just about ALL barriers of entry are removed, and it is really simple to 'do it',  it takes a lot of effort to create something.

And the reason is simple. There is always a good crowd that has 'ideas' on what should happen. But the hard part is to actually 'do it' (or create a good brief so that it can be delegated/contracted-out).

Another key concept about this model is that it is not done by the OWASP Board or Committee. I think it is very important that initiatives like this happen from the 'bottom-up' and not from the 'top-down'. That said, I have asked both OWASP Board and GPC (Global Projects Committee) to provide some seed funds, since that is the equivalent of directly investing on OWASP projects.

And you, dear reader (maybe from a company that likes what OWASP is doing or a leader of an OWASP Chapter ),  if you have funds that you would to see put to a good use , please allocated some of it to this project :)

What do you think? Any comments, ideas, criticisms, suggestions, etc...?
