##  Call For Training - OWASP 2013 LATAM Tour 

Please see bellow's Kate's email about the amazing OWASP Tour that they are organizing at LATAM. As the guy who did the [first OWASP Tour](http://blog.diniscruz.com/2010/08/owaspo2-us-tour-aug-9-17-6-cities-in-8.html) I'm very happy to see that this idea is finally taking shape.

Now if only we could do the same around Europe :)

  
Btw, If you are in the Latin America (or want to go there), this is a great opportunity to be involved
