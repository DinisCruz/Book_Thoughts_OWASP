My only worry is that there is SO MUCH to do!!! and Samantha is only one :(

Last time I spoke with Samantha she was still under the impression that she would only need help in late 2014, I hope that she will soon realize that there are a lot of areas where she could do with more resources (starting with resources to do actual 'project management', since at the moment she doesn't have the time to do that for the projects that really need it)
