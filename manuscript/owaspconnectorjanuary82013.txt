OWASP Application Security Guide for CISOs Project

  


The purpose of this document is to guide the CISO in managing application security from initial problem statement to delivery of the solution. We start this journey with the creation of the business cases for investing in application security following with the awareness of threats targeting applications, the identification of the economical impacts, the determination of a risk mitigation strategy, the prioritization of the mitigation of the risk of vulnerabilities, the selection of security control measures to mitigate risks, the adoption of secure software development processes and maturity models and we conclude this journey with the selection of metrics for reporting and managing application security risk. Please contact Marco Morana if you wish to contribute to the project.

  


OWASP O-Saft Project

  


This tools lists information about remote target's SSL certificate and tests the remote target's SSL connection according given list of ciphers and various SSL configurations. Please contact Achim Hoffmann if you wish to contribute to the project.

Welcome to OWASP 2013!

![Coates_10(3)](images/aa6d887ad6f248eb8a77c8a6391cda5b.jpg)  


OWASP has made tremendous strides over the past decade and we're looking forward to an exciting 2013. As we all see in news nearly every day technology is playing an increasing role in every aspect of our lives. Unfortunately, in many situations failures in application security are placing users and data at risk. As we continue to foster technology growth and further integration with web applications the security of our systems will dictate the success or failure of many initiatives.  Let's leverage security as an enable to safely drive technology into new and expanded roles throughout the world.

Join us in 2013 to build the OWASP community. Join your local chapter, contribute to a project or join us at a conference or on our mailing list to discuss issues on your mind. OWASP is a platform to make application security risks visible, encourage research, and increase knowledge sharing. We're looking forward to a great year and hope you can join us to continue advancing OWASP and the field of application security.
